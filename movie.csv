0,"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before .",pos
1,"for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .",pos
2,to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .,pos
3,"the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .",pos
4,"in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .",pos
5,"if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes .",pos
6,"getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?",pos
7,"the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end .",pos
8,"it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .",pos
9,"when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .",pos
10,"abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium .",pos
11,"upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach .",pos
12,"i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .",pos
13,"in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .",pos
14,"it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .",pos
15,"and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .",pos
16,don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it .,pos
17,"now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .",pos
18,"the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .",pos
19,oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .,pos
20,"even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .",pos
21,"ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .",pos
22,"i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad .",pos
23,"the film , however , is all good .",pos
24,"2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content",pos
0,"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling .",pos
1,"mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example .",pos
2,did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ?,pos
1,it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer .,neg
2,"maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen .",neg
3,"my recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film .",neg
4,"as it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv .",neg
5,a big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show .,neg
6,"the kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so .",neg
7,and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics .,neg
8,brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression .,neg
9,"in typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles .",neg
10,doctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug .,neg
11,"then , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace .",neg
12,the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film .,neg
13,"at about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long .",neg
14,"the best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit .",neg
15,"but with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough .",neg
16,"strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv .",neg
17,the movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating .,neg
18,"one of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower .",neg
19,"in the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail .",neg
20,"the kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task .",neg
21,"there are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one .",neg
0,there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director .,neg
1,"of course , his best film was 1978's masterpiece , "" halloween , "" but he also made 1980's "" the fog , "" and 1987's underrated , "" prince of darkness . """,neg
2,"heck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with "" in the mouth of madness . """,neg
3,"but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , "" memoirs of an invisible man . """,neg
4,"somehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , "" village of the damned , "" to his uninspired 1996 sequel , "" escape from l . a . "" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , "" john carpenter's vampires . """,neg
5,"if i was him , i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title .",neg
6,"it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , "" vampires . """,neg
7,the story is simple .,neg
8,"jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) .",neg
9,"since katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her .",neg
10,"it seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him .",neg
11,my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ?,neg
12,"well , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made .",neg
13,""" john carpenter's vampires , "" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen .",neg
14,"in fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time .",neg
15,"the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's .",neg
16,"and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent .",neg
17,"there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters .",neg
18,"james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue .",neg
19,"daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense .",neg
20,"and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in "" twin peaks "" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore .",neg
21,"there is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , "" john carpenter's vamires , "" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's .",neg
22,"he has said that he turned down directing , "" halloween : h20 , "" because he couldn't work up any excitement for it .",neg
23,"and yet , when asked about a "" vampires "" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it .",neg
24,"i think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points .",neg
0,"two party guys bob their heads to haddaway's dance hit "" what is love ? """,neg
1,while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub .,neg
2,"it's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring "" roxbury guys "" sketch that would presumably make a good feature .",neg
3,"emphasis on the word "" presumably . """,neg
4,_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels .,neg
5,"the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original "" roxbury guys "" skits .",neg
6,"with "" what is love ? """,neg
7,"blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out "" hotties "" at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts .",neg
8,"there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak .",neg
9,"that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters .",neg
10,"the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends .",neg
11,"there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots .",neg
12,"the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club .",neg
13,"there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs .",neg
14,"meanwhile , the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing .",neg
15,"when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two .",neg
16,"the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is .",neg
17,"the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end .",neg
18,"alas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film .",neg
19,"granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration .",neg
20,that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves .,neg
21,"like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , "" the roxbury guys "" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context .",neg
22,"after watching one of the "" roxbury "" skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to "" what is love ? "" ,",neg
23,"bump unsuspecting women , and . . . that's all .",neg
24,"after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you'll be left with exactly the same .",neg

4,george washington carver high school is having student elections .,pos
5,"tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high .",pos
6,"mr . "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run .",pos
7,"and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons .",pos
8,"the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be .",pos
9,"you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have .",pos
10,"_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype .",pos
11,"what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier .",pos
12,the similarities are staggering :,pos
13,"tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .",pos
14,"max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .",pos

20,he even gets a bee sting .,pos
21,"the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .",pos
22,he gets several bee stings .,pos
23,and so on .,pos
24,what happened ?,pos
25,"how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ?",pos
26,"even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy .",pos
27,"broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then .",pos
28,witherspoon is a revelation .,pos
29,"it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination .",pos
30,"and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over .",pos
31,one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it .,pos
32,there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .,pos
33,"i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . .",pos
34,"but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .",pos
35,"as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story .",pos
36,"it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ?",pos
37,"even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does .",pos
38,"there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment .",pos
0,you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to .,pos
1,"in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits .",pos
2,"no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) .",pos
3,"essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking .",pos
4,"it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative .",pos
5,"but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is .",pos
6,"but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle .",pos
7,"it couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman .",pos
8,"i haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ?",pos
9,"if you like something so much , why even question it ?",pos
10,"again , the storyline is as cliched as they come .",pos
11,"tom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner .",pos
12,fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business .,pos
13,"little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity .",pos
14,the rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen .,pos
15,"sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship .",pos
16,"all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax .",pos
17,"but as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does .",pos
18,"when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling .",pos
0,""" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen .",pos
1,"the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds .",pos
2,"then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score .",pos
3,dah-dum .,pos
4,"from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly .",pos
5,"right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip .",pos
6,"perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie .",pos
7,"he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act .",pos
8,"unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act .",pos
9,"until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music .",pos
10,"he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying .",pos
11,he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .,pos
12,"the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .",pos
13,"the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .",pos
14,"brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .",pos
15,"hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying .",pos
16,"when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark .",pos
17,"the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it .",pos
18,""" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror .",pos
19,"it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) .",pos
20,"even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age .",pos
21,"although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .",pos
22,"the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects .",pos
23,"scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman .",pos
24,"nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .",pos
25,scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town .,pos
26,""" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him .",pos
27,"dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .",pos
28,"however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .",pos
29,"bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .",pos
30,"he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .",pos
31,"however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .",pos
32,quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s .,pos
33,"indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese .",pos
34,"his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .",pos
35,"shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film .",pos
36,"of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .",pos
37,"a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat .",pos
38,"every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .",pos
39,"the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .",pos
40,"many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .",pos
41,"but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .",pos
0,moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources .,pos
1,every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers .,pos
2,"in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him .",pos
3,"in the movies , you end up with films like "" spawn "" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors .",pos
4,jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking .,pos
5,he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line .,pos
6,"watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages .",pos
7,"but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him .",pos
8,"almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills .",pos
9,"this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence .",pos
10,this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain .,pos
11,"( chan's first release in this country , "" rumble in the bronx "" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . )",pos
12,"heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist .",pos
13,"in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu .",pos
14,"jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) .",pos
15,"he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , "" jackie , save us ! "" , and misuse firearms .",pos
16,"the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil .",pos
17,"en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives .",pos

7,""" star trek : insurrection , "" is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996's "" first contact , "" which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different .",neg
8,"in , "" insurrection , "" however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement .",neg
9,"the film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff .",neg
10,"meanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly .",neg

2,"the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell .",neg
3,"todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else .",neg

0,"i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release .",neg
1,"michael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof .",neg
2,"the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) .",neg
3,"greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes .",neg

5,"it appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line .",neg
6,"if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words .",neg
7,"but , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest .",neg
8,"it's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor .",neg
9,"for the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk .",neg
10,wish me luck .,neg
11,first and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport .,neg
12,"while i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke .",neg
13,"he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions .",neg
14,another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character .,neg
15,"they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there .",neg
16,"it's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis .",neg
17,"but now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ?",neg
18,"enough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience .",neg
19,"it's stupid , pointless and repetitive .",neg
20,"i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone .",neg
21,"action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited .",neg
22,and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks .,neg
23,"don't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs .",neg
24,"it's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced .",neg
25,the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed .,neg
26,"it's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure .",neg
27,"coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie .",neg
28,"especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film .",neg
29,"things get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat .",neg
30,"if that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover .",neg
4,"norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year .",pos
5,"he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) .",pos
6,"the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .",pos
7,"we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .",pos
8,"in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .",pos
9,"much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy .",pos
10,"when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .",pos
11,"what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .",pos
12,"it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material .",pos
13,"because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .",pos
14,"i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart .",pos
15,the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .,pos
16,"it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .",pos
17,"of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .",pos
18,it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest .,pos
19,"in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease .",pos
20,"even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead .",pos
21,what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .,pos
22,"the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien .",pos
23,"visually , the film is very powerful .",pos
24,"kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .",pos
25,"but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .",pos
26,"although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed .",pos
27,"for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .",pos
28,"it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film .",pos
29,perhaps this last scene was the problem .,pos
30,"it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .",pos
0,one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding .,pos
1,and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it .,pos
2,"her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 .",pos
3,"but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film .",pos
4,"and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .",pos
5,"written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .",pos
6,alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .,pos
7,"as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting .",pos
8,"walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob .",pos
9,ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain .,pos
10,"she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits .",pos
11,"she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown .",pos
12,"and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance .",pos
13,"thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .",pos
14,"the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family .",pos
15,"ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .",pos
16,"walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .",pos
17,"when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . """,pos
18,"ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises .",pos
19,sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .,pos
20,"it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight .",pos
21,"lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry .",pos
22,lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .,pos
23,"and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure .",pos
24,"lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .",pos
25,"i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed .",pos
26,"the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .",pos
27,"joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) .",pos
28,"alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .",pos
29,"the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it .",pos
30,"as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .",pos
31,"and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .",pos
